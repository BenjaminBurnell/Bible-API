# Bible API

## Overview

**Bible API** is a lightweight and open-source web service that allows anyone to access Bible text by **version**, **book**, **chapter**, or **verse** through a simple RESTful interface.  
It retrieves data directly from [BenjaminBurnell/Bible](https://github.com/BenjaminBurnell/Bible) — ensuring accuracy and easy version updates — and is powered by **FastAPI** for fast, reliable performance.

## Features

- **Version Support** — Access different Bible translations (e.g., KJV, WEBUS).  
- **Verse Lookup** — Fetch any verse using `/verse/{version}/{book}/{chapter}/{verse}`.  
- **Chapter Retrieval** — Get full chapters with `/chapter/{version}/{book}/{chapter}`.  
- **GitHub JSON Integration** — Bible data is stored and versioned directly in GitHub.  
- **CORS-Enabled** — Safe for frontend and browser-based use.  
- **Free & Public** — Anyone can use the API with no authentication required.

## How It Works

The API dynamically fetches structured JSON files stored in GitHub.  
Each Bible version is organized by book and chapter, for example:

```
bible_data/
└── KJV/
    └── GEN/
        ├── 1.json
        ├── 2.json
```

When a request is made:
1. FastAPI routes the query (e.g. `/verse/KJV/GEN/1/1`).
2. The corresponding JSON is fetched from GitHub.  
3. The specific verse or chapter is returned as a clean JSON response.

## Example Usage

### Get a Verse
```
GET /verse/KJV/GEN/1/1
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "version": "KJV",
  "book": "GEN",
  "chapter": 1,
  "verse": 1,
  "text": "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
}
```

### Get a Chapter
```
GET /chapter/KJV/GEN/1
```
